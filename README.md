# pygame-space-dodge
Space Dodge is a simple arcade-style game built with Python and Pygame, where the player controls a small spaceship that must dodge falling stars for as long as possible. The goal is to survive as long as you can without being hit, while the difficulty increases over time as stars fall faster and more frequently.
